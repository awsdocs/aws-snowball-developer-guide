# Managing AWS services on your device<a name="manage-services"></a>

With AWS OpsHub, you can use and manage AWS services on your Snow Family devices\. Currently, AWS OpsHub supports the following resources:
+ Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances – Use Amazon EC2 instances to run software installed on a virtual server without sending it to the AWS Cloud for processing\.
+ Network File System \(NFS\) – Use file shares to move data to your device\. You can ship the device to AWS to transfer your data to the AWS Cloud, or use DataSync to transfer to other AWS Cloud locations\.
