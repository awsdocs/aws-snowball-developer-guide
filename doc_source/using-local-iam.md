# Using IAM Locally<a name="using-local-iam"></a>

AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) helps you securely control access to AWS resources that run on your AWS Snowball Edge device\. You use IAM to control who is authenticated \(signed in\) and authorized \(has permissions\) to use resources\. 

IAM is supported locally on your device\. You can use the local IAM service to create new users and attach IAM policies to them\. You can use these policies to allow the access necessary to perform assigned tasks\. For example, you can give a user the ability to transfer data, but limit their ability to create new Amazon EC2 instances\.

Additionally, you can create local, session\-based credentials using AWS Security Token Service \(AWS STS\) on your device\. For information about the IAM service, see [Getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/GettingStartedGuide/) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

Your device's root credentials can't be disabled, and you can't use policies within your account to explicitly deny access to the AWS account root user\. We recommend that you secure your root user access keys and create IAM user credentials for everyday interaction with your device\.

**Important**  
The documentation in this section applies to using IAM locally on an AWS Snowball Edge device\. For information about using IAM in the AWS Cloud, see [Identity and Access Management in AWS Snowball](snowball-edge-iam.md)\.  
For AWS services to work properly on a Snowball Edge, you must allow the ports for the services\. For details, see [Ports Required to Use AWS Services on an AWS Snowball Edge Device](port-requirements.md)\.

## Using the AWS CLI and API Operations on Snowball Edge<a name="local-iam-specify-region"></a>

When using the AWS CLI or API operations to issue IAM, AWS STS, Amazon S3, and Amazon EC2 commands on Snowball Edge, you must specify the `region` as "`snow`\." You can do this using `aws configure` or within the command itself, as in the following examples\.

```
aws configure --profile abc
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: 1234567
Default region name [None]: snow
Default output format [None]: json
```

Or

```
aws iam list-users --profile snowballEdge --endpoint http://192.0.2.0:6078 --region snow 
```

**Note**  
The access key ID and access secret key that are used locally on AWS Snowball Edge can't be interchanged with the keys in the AWS Cloud\.

### Supported IAM Policy Version and Grammar<a name="iam-policy"></a>

Following is the local IAM support version 2012\-10\-17 of the IAM policy and a subset of the policy grammar\.


| Policy type | Supported grammar | 
| --- | --- | 
| Identity\-based policies \(user/role policy\) | "Effect", "Action" and "Resource"  Local IAM doesn't support "`Condition`", "`NotAction`", "`NotResource`" and "`Principal`"\.    | 
| Resource\-based policies \(role trust policy\) | "Effect", "Action" and "Principal"  For Principal, only AWS account ID or principal ID is allowed\.   | 

## IAM Policy Examples<a name="policy-examples"></a>

## TrustPolicy Example<a name="role-policy-example-trust"></a>

A trust policy returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access AWS resources that you might normally not have access to\. These temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token\. Typically, you use `AssumeRole` in your account for cross\-account access\. 

The following is an example of a trust policy\. For more information about trust policy, see [AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) in the *AWS Security Token Service API Reference*\.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::AccountId:root" //You can use the Principal ID instead of the account ID. 
                ]
            },
            "Action": [
                "sts:AssumeRole"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
