# What is AWS Snowball Edge?<a name="whatisedge"></a>

AWS Snowball Edge is a type of Snowball device with on\-board storage and compute power for select AWS capabilities\. Snowball Edge can do local processing and edge\-computing workloads in addition to transferring data between your local environment and the AWS Cloud\.

Each Snowball Edge device can transport data at speeds faster than the internet\. This transport is done by shipping the data in the appliances through a regional carrier\. The appliances are rugged, complete with E Ink shipping labels\. 

Snowball Edge devices have four options for device configurationsâ€”*Storage Optimized*, *Compute Optimized*, *Compute Optimized with GPU*, and *Import virtual tapes into AWS Storage Gateway*\. When this guide refers to Snowball Edge devices, it's referring to all options of the device\. When specific information applies only to one or more optional configurations of devices \(such as how the Snowball Edge with GPU has an on\-board GPU\), it is called out specifically\. For more information, see [Snowball Edge Device Options](device-differences.md#device-options)\.

## Prerequisites for using Snow Family devices<a name="snowball-prereqs"></a>

### Sign up for an AWS account<a name="sign-up-for-aws"></a>

If you do not have an AWS account, complete the following steps to create one\.

**To sign up for an AWS account**

1. Open [https://portal\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad\.

   When you sign up for an AWS account, an *AWS account root user* is created\. The root user has access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. As a security best practice, [assign administrative access to an administrative user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html), and use only the root user to perform [tasks that require root user access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html)\.

AWS sends you a confirmation email after the sign\-up process is complete\. At any time, you can view your current account activity and manage your account by going to [https://aws\.amazon\.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/) and choosing **My Account**\.

### Create an administrative user<a name="create-an-admin"></a>

After you sign up for an AWS account, create an administrative user so that you don't use the root user for everyday tasks\.

**Secure your AWS account root user**

1.  Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) as the account owner by choosing **Root user** and entering your AWS account email address\. On the next page, enter your password\.

   For help signing in by using root user, see [Signing in as the root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/console-sign-in-tutorials.html#introduction-to-root-user-sign-in-tutorial) in the *AWS Sign\-In User Guide*\.

1. Turn on multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) for your root user\.

   For instructions, see [Enable a virtual MFA device for your AWS account root user \(console\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_virtual.html#enable-virt-mfa-for-root) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

**Create an administrative user**
+ For your daily administrative tasks, grant administrative access to an administrative user in AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\)\.

  For instructions, see [Getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) in the *AWS IAM Identity Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\) User Guide*\.

**Sign in as the administrative user**
+ To sign in with your IAM Identity Center user, use the sign\-in URL that was sent to your email address when you created the IAM Identity Center user\.

  For help signing in using an IAM Identity Center user, see [Signing in to the AWS access portal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/iam-id-center-sign-in-tutorial.html) in the *AWS Sign\-In User Guide*\.

### Prerequisites for using Amazon S3 adapter on Snow Family devices for import and export jobs<a name="s3-prereqs"></a>

You will use S3 adapter on Snow Family devices when you are using the devices to move data from on\-premises data sources to the cloud or from the cloud to on\-premises data storage\.

**Note**  
You must select S3 adapter on Snow when you order devices\. See [Step 2: Choose your compute and storage options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/developer-guide/compute-storage.html) in this guide\.

The Amazon S3 bucket associated with the job must use the Amazon S3 standard storage class\. Before creating your first job, keep the following in mind\.

For jobs that import data into Amazon S3, follow these steps:
+ Confirm that the files and folders to transfer are named according to the [object key naming guidelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html#object-key-guidelines) for Amazon S3\. Any files or folders with names that don't meet these guidelines aren't imported into Amazon S3\.
+ Plan what data you want to import into Amazon S3\. For more information, see [Planning Your Large Transfer](copy-general-planning.md)\.

Before exporting data from Amazon S3, follow these steps:
+ Understand what data is exported when you create your job\. For more information, see [Using Export Ranges](exporttype.md#ranges)\.
+ For any files with a colon \(`:`\) in the file name, change the file names in Amazon S3 before you create the export job to get these files\. Files with a colon in the file name fail export to Microsoft Windows Server\. 

### Prerequisites for using Amazon S3 compatible storage on Snow Family devices<a name="s3-on-snowprereqs"></a>

You will use Amazon S3 compatible storage on Snow Family devices when you are storing data on the device at your edge location and using the data for local compute operations\. To migrate data to or from AWS, set up an export or import job and use the Amazon S3 adapter\. 

When ordering a Snow device for local compute and storage with Amazon S3 compatible storage, keep the following in mind\.
+ You will provision Amazon S3 storage capacity when you order the device\. So consider your storage need before ordering a device\.
+ You can create Amazon S3 buckets on the device after you receive it rather than while ordering a Snow Family device\.
+ You will need to download the latest version of the AWS CLI, Snowball Edge client, or AWS OpsHub and install it on your computer to use Amazon S3 compatible storage on Snow Family devices\.

### Prerequisites for using compute instances on Snow Family devices<a name="compute-prereqes"></a>

For jobs using compute instances, before you can add any AMIs to your job, you must have an AMI in your AWS account and it must be a supported image type\. Currently, supported AMIs are based on these operating systems:
+ [Amazon Linux 2](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B08Q76DLTM)
+ [CentOS 7 \(x86\_64\) \- with Updates HVM](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00O7WM7QW)
+ Ubuntu 16\.04 LTS \- Xenial \(HVM\)
+ [Ubuntu 20\.04 LTS \- Focal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-iftkyuwv2sjxi)
+ [Ubuntu 22\.04 LTS \- Jammy](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-f2if34z3a4e3i)
+ [Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-g3y27m7b55tag)
+ [Microsoft Windows Server 2016](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-fsarquezghuic)
+ [Microsoft Windows Server 2019](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-bd6o47htpbnoe)

**Note**  
Ubuntu 16\.04 LTS \- Xenial \(HVM\) images are no longer supported in the AWS Marketplace, but still supported for use on Snowball Edge devices through Amazon EC2 VM Import/Export and running locally in AMIs\.

You can get these images from [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace)\.

If you're using SSH to connect to the instances running on a Snowball Edge, you must already have the key pair for connecting to the instance\. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 key pairs and Linux instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances\.

For information specific to using compute instances on a device, see [Using Amazon EC2 Compute Instances](using-ec2.md)\.
