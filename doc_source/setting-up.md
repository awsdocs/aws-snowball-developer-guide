# Setting Up Your AWS Access for AWS Snowball Edge<a name="setting-up"></a>

Before you use AWS Snowball for the first time, you need to complete the following tasks:

1. [Sign Up for AWS](#setting-up-signup)\.
**Note**  
In the Asia Pacific \(Mumbai\) AWS Region service is provided by Amaz on Internet Services Private Limited \(AISPL\)\. For information on signing up for Amazon Web Services in the Asia Pacific \(Mumbai\) AWS Region, see [Signing Up for AISPL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-account-payment-aispl.html#aisplsignup)\.

1. [Create an IAM User](#setting-up-iam)\.

## Sign Up for AWS<a name="setting-up-signup"></a>

When you sign up for Amazon Web Services \(AWS\), your AWS account is automatically signed up for all services in AWS, including AWS Snowball\. You are charged only for the services that you use\. For more information about pricing and fees for AWS Snowball, see [AWS Snowball Edge Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/snowball-edge/pricing)\. AWS Snowball is not free to use; for more information on what AWS services are free, see [AWS Free Usage Tier](http://aws.amazon.com/free/)\.

If you have an AWS account already, skip to the next task\. If you don't have an AWS account, use the following procedure to create one\.

**To create an AWS account**

1. Open [https://portal\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad\.

Note your AWS account number, because you'll need it for the next task\.

## Create an IAM User<a name="setting-up-iam"></a>

Services in AWS, such as AWS Snowball, require that you provide credentials when you access them, so that the service can determine whether you have permission to access its resources\. AWS recommends not using the root credentials of your AWS account to make requests\. Instead, create an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user, and grant that user full access\. We refer to these users as IAM users with administrator\-level credentials\.

You can use the administrator user credentials, instead of root credentials of your account, to interact with AWS and perform tasks, such as to create an Amazon S3 bucket, create users, and grant them permissions\. For more information, see [Root Account Credentials vs\. IAM User Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html) in the *AWS General Reference* and [IAM Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAMBestPractices.html) in *IAM User Guide*\. 

If you signed up for AWS but have not created an IAM user for yourself, you can create one using the IAM console\.

**To create an administrator user for yourself and add the user to an administrators group \(console\)**

1. Sign in to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/) as the account owner by choosing **Root user** and entering your AWS account email address\. On the next page, enter your password\.
**Note**  
We strongly recommend that you adhere to the best practice of using the **Administrator** IAM user below and securely lock away the root user credentials\. Sign in as the root user only to perform a few [account and service management tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tasks-that-require-root.html)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users** and then choose **Add user**\.

1. For **User name**, enter **Administrator**\.

1. Select the check box next to **AWS Management Console access**\. Then select **Custom password**, and then enter your new password in the text box\.

1. \(Optional\) By default, AWS requires the new user to create a new password when first signing in\. You can clear the check box next to **User must create a new password at next sign\-in** to allow the new user to reset their password after they sign in\.

1. Choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. Under **Set permissions**, choose **Add user to group**\.

1. Choose **Create group**\.

1. In the **Create group** dialog box, for **Group name** enter **Administrators**\.

1. Choose **Filter policies**, and then select **AWS managed \-job function** to filter the table contents\.

1. In the policy list, select the check box for **AdministratorAccess**\. Then choose **Create group**\.
**Note**  
You must activate IAM user and role access to Billing before you can use the `AdministratorAccess` permissions to access the AWS Billing and Cost Management console\. To do this, follow the instructions in [step 1 of the tutorial about delegating access to the billing console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_billing.html)\.

1. Back in the list of groups, select the check box for your new group\. Choose **Refresh** if necessary to see the group in the list\.

1. Choose **Next: Tags**\.

1. \(Optional\) Add metadata to the user by attaching tags as key\-value pairs\. For more information about using tags in IAM, see [Tagging IAM Entities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_tags.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

1. Choose **Next: Review** to see the list of group memberships to be added to the new user\. When you are ready to proceed, choose **Create user**\.

You can use this same process to create more groups and users and to give your users access to your AWS account resources\. To learn about using policies that restrict user permissions to specific AWS resources, see [Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html) and [Example Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_examples.html)\.

To sign in as this new IAM user, sign out of the AWS Management Console, then use the following URL, where *your\_aws\_account\_id* is your AWS account number without the hyphens \(for example, if your AWS account number is `1234-5678-9012`, your AWS account ID is `123456789012`\)\.

```
https://your_aws_account_id.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/
```

Type the IAM user name and password that you just created\. When you're signed in, the navigation bar displays "*your\_user\_name* @ *your\_aws\_account\_id*"\.

If you don't want the URL for your sign\-in page to contain your AWS account ID, you can create an account alias\. From the IAM dashboard, choose **Create Account Alias** and type an alias, such as your company name\. To sign in after you create an account alias, use the following URL\.

```
https://your_account_alias.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/
```

To verify the sign\-in link for IAM users for your account, open the IAM console and check under **AWS Account Alias** on the dashboard\.

If you're going to create AWS Snowball jobs through an IAM user that is not an administrator user, that user needs certain permissions to use the AWS Snowball Management Console effectively\. For more information on those permissions, see [Permissions Required to Use the AWS Snowball Console](access-control-managing-permissions.md#additional-console-required-permissions)\.
