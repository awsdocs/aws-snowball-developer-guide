# Using AWS Snow Device Management to Manage Devices<a name="aws-sdm"></a>

AWS Snow Device Management allows you to manage your Snow Family device and local AWS services remotely\. All Snow Family devices support Snow Device Management, and it comes preinstalled on new devices in most AWS Regions where Snow Family devices are available\.

You can order a new device installed with Snow Device Management in the following ways:
+ When you order a new Snow Family device from the AWS Management Console, you specify which state Snow Device Management is in when the device arrives\. Snow Device Management can be installed in the following states: 
  + `INSTALLED_ONLY` – Snow Device Management is installed but not activated\. 
  + `INSTALLED_AUTOSTART` – Snow Device Management is installed, and the device attempts to connect to its AWS Region when it is powered on\. 
+ When you order a new Snow Family device through the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\) or an AWS SDK, you use the `--remote-management` parameter to specify the `INSTALLED_ONLY` or `INSTALLED_AUTOSTART` states when running the `create-job` command\. If you don't specify a value for this parameter, Snow Device Management defaults to `INSTALLED_ONLY` for supported devices\.
**Note**  
It is not possible to order a new Snow Family device without preinstalled Snow Device Management feature artifacts\. The `NOT_INSTALLED` state exists only to identify devices that don't support the feature or that were already in the field before its launch\. If you don't want to use Snow Device Management, set it to the INSTALLED\_ONLY state\.  
Snow Device Management can't be added to a Snow Family device that is already deployed in the field\. To use Snow Device Management, you must order a new device with the feature preinstalled\.

The following example shows the syntax for the `--remote-management` parameter, in addition to other parameters that you might include for a typical `create-job` command\. For more information, see [Job Management API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/api-reference/api-reference.html) in the "AWS Snow Family API Reference" guide\.

**Command**

```
aws snowball create-job \
        --job-type IMPORT \
        --remote-management INSTALLED_AUTOSTART
        --device-configuration '{"SnowconeDeviceConfiguration": {"WirelessConnection": {"IsWifiEnabled": false} } }' \
        --resources '{"S3Resources":[{"BucketArn":"arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name"}]}' \
        --description "Description here" \
        --address-id ADID00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \
        --kms-key-arn arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab \
        --role-arn arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/SnowconeImportGamma \
        --snowball-capacity-preference T8 \
        --shipping-option NEXT_DAY \
        --snowball-type SNC1_HDD \
        --region us-west-2 \

## Managing devices remotely<a name="manage-device-remotely"></a>

If you specified `INSTALLED_AUTOSTART` for Snow Device Management during the job order, the feature is ready to use immediately when your Snow Family device arrives and is powered on for the first time\.

If you specified `INSTALLED_ONLY` when ordering your device, you must change the feature state to `INSTALLED_AUTOSTART` before the device can call back to its AWS Region to enable remote management\. You can enable Snow Device Management at any time after you receive and unlock your device\.

## Enabling Snow Device Management<a name="enable-sdm"></a>

Follow this procedure to enable Snow Device Management using the Snowball Edge CLI\.

**Note**  
This procedure requires the Snowball Edge client\. Make sure you've installed the latest Snowball Edge client before you proceed\. For more information, see [Downloading and Installing the Snowball Client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/developer-guide/using-client.html#download-client)\.

**To enable Snow Device Management on your device**

1. To download the manifest file for the job from AWS, use the following command\. Replace *placeholder values* with your information\.

   **Command**

   ```
   aws snowball get-job-manifest
   --job-id JID970A5018-F8KE-4D06-9F7B-335C1C7221E4
   ```

   **Output**

   ```
   {
       "ManifestURI": "https://awsie-frosty-manifests-prod.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/JID970A5018-F8KE-4D06-9F7B-335C1C7221E4_manifest.bin"
   }
   ```

1. To download the unlock code for the job from AWS, use the following command\. Replace *placeholder values* with your information\.

   **Command**

   ```
   aws snowball get-job-unlock-code
   --job-id JID970A5018-F8KE-4D06-9F7B-335C1C7221E4
   ```

   **Output**

   ```
   {
       "UnlockCode": "7c0e1-bab84-f7675-0a2b6-f8k33"
   }
   ```

1. Use a compatible power adapter to power your device and turn it on\. Then connect the device to your network using an Ethernet cable or a Wi\-Fi connection\. For more information, see [AWS Snowcone Power Supply and Accessories](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/snowcone-guide/snowcone-spec-requirements.html#snowcone-power-supply)\.

1. Make note of the local IP address shown on the device’s display\. You'll need this IP address for the next steps\. This IP address is either obtained automatically through DHCP or statically configured\. 

1. To unlock the device, use the following command\. Replace *placeholder values* with your information\. For the `--endpoint` parameter, specify the device local IP address you noted previously\.

   **Command**

   ```
   snowballEdge unlock-device
   --manifest-file JID1717d8cc-2dc9-4e68-aa46-63a3ad7927d2_manifest.bin
   --unlock-code 7c0e1-bab84-f7675-0a2b6-f8k33
   --endpoint https://10.186.0.56:9091
   ```

   **Output**

   ```
   Your Snowball Edge device is unlocking. You may determine the unlock state of your device using the describe-device command. 
   Your Snowball Edge device will be available for use when it is in the UNLOCKED state.
   ```

1. \(Optional\) To describe the features of the device, use the following command\. Replace *placeholder values* with your information\. For the `--endpoint` parameter, specify the device local IP address you noted previously\.

   **Command**

   ```
   snowballEdge describe-features 
   --manifest-file JID1717d8cc-2dc9-4e68-aa46-63a3ad7927d2_manifest.bin
   --unlock-code 7c0e1-bab84-f7675-0a2b6-f8k33
   --endpoint https://10.186.0.56:9091
   ```

   **Output**

   ```
   {
     "RemoteManagementState" : "INSTALLED_ONLY"
   }
   ```

1. To enable Snow Device Management, use the following command\. Replace *placeholder values* with your information\. For the `--endpoint` parameter, specify the device local IP address you noted previously\.

   **Command**

   ```
   snowballEdge set-features
   --remote-management-state INSTALLED_AUTOSTART
   --manifest-file JID1717d8cc-2dc9-4e68-aa46-63a3ad7927d2_manifest.bin
   --unlock-code 7c0e1-bab84-f7675-0a2b6-f8k33
   --endpoint https://10.186.0.56:9091
   ```

   **Output**

   ```
   {
     "RemoteManagementState" : "INSTALLED_AUTOSTART"
   }
   ```

1. On the AWS account from which the device was ordered, create an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) role, and add the following policy to the role\. Then, assign the role to the IAM user who will log in to remotely manage your device with Snow Device Management\. For more information, see [Creating IAM roles](IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create.html) and [Creating an IAM user in your AWS account](IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html)\. 

   **Policy**

   ```
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
