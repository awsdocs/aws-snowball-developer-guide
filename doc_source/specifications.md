## Supported Network Hardware<a name="network-hardware"></a>

To use the AWS Snowball Edge device, you need your own network cables\. For RJ45 cables, there are no specific recommendations\. SFP28 and QSFP28 cables and modules from Mellanox and Finisar have been verified to be compatible with the device\.

After you open the back panel of the AWS Snowball Edge device, you see the network ports shown in the following photograph\.

![\[The available network ports\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/developer-guide/images/snowball-edge-back-connectors.png)

Only one network interface on the AWS Snowball Edge device can be used at a time\. Hence use any one of the ports to support the following network hardware\.

**SFP**  
This port provides a 10G/25G SFP28 interface compatible with SFP28 and SFP\+ transceiver modules and direct\-attach copper \(DAC\) cables\. You must provide your own transceivers or DAC cables\.
+ For 10G operation, you can use any SFP\+ option\. Examples include:
  + 10Gbase\-LR \(single mode fiber\) transceiver
  + 10Gbase\-SR \(multi\-mode fiber\) transceiver
  + SFP\+ DAC cable
+ For 25G operation, you can use any SFP28 option\. Examples include:
  + 25Gbase\-LR \(single mode fiber\) transceiver
  + 25Gbase\-SR \(multi\-mode fiber\) transceiver
  + SFP28 DAC cable

![\[SFP+ Copper\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/developer-guide/images/sfp.png)

**QSFP**  
This port provides a 40G QSFP28 interface on storage\-optimized devices and a 40/50/100G QSFP28 interface on compute\-optimized devices\. Both are compatible with QSFP\+ transceiver modules and DAC cables\. You must provide your own transceivers or DAC cables\. Examples include the following:
+ 40Gbase\-LR4 \(single mode fiber\) transceiver
+ 40Gbase\-SR4 \(multi\-mode fiber\) transceiver
+ QSFP28 DAC

![\[QSFP+\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/developer-guide/images/qsfp.png)

**RJ45**  
This port provides 1Gbase\-TX/10Gbase\-TX operation\. It is connected via UTP cable terminated with an RJ45 connector\. Compute\-optimized devices have two RJ45 ports\.

1G operation is indicated by a blinking amber light\. 1G operation is not recommended for large\-scale data transfers to the Snowball Edge device, as it dramatically increases the time it takes to transfer data\.

10G operation is indicated by a blinking green light\. It requires a Cat6A UTP cable with a maximum operating distance of 180 feet \(55 meters\)\.
