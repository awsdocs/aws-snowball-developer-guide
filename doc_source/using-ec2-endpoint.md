# Using the Amazon EC2 Endpoint<a name="using-ec2-endpoint"></a>

Following, you can find an overview of the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) endpoint\. Using this endpoint, you can manage your Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\) and compute instances programmatically using Amazon EC2 API operations\.

## Specifying the Amazon EC2 Endpoint as the AWS CLI Endpoint<a name="using-ec2-adapter-cli-endpoint"></a>

When you use the AWS CLI to issue a command to the AWS Snowball Edge device, you can specify that the endpoint is the Amazon EC2 endpoint\. You have the choice of using the HTTPS endpoint, or an unsecured HTTP endpoint, as shown following\.

**HTTPS secured endpoint**

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --endpoint https://192.0.2.0:8243 --ca-bundle path/to/certificate
```

**HTTP unsecured endpoint**

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --endpoint http://192.0.2.0:8008
```

If you use the HTTPS endpoint of `8243`, your data in transit is encrypted\. This encryption is ensured with a certificate that's generated by the Snowball Edge whenever it is unlocked\. After you have your certificate, you can save it to a local `ca-bundle.pem` file\. Then you can configure your AWS CLI profile to include the path to your certificate, as described following\.

**To associate your certificate with the Amazon EC2 endpoint**

1. Connect the Snowball Edge to power and network, and turn it on\.

1. After the device has finished unlocking, make a note of its IP address on your local network\.

1. From a terminal on your network, make sure you can ping the Snowball Edge\.

1. Run the `snowballEdge get-certificate` command in your terminal\. For more information on this command, see [Getting Your Certificate for Transferring Data](using-client-commands.md#snowball-edge-certificates-cli)\.

1. Save the output of the `snowballEdge get-certificate` command to a file, for example `ca-bundle.pem`\.

1. Run the following command from your terminal\.

   ```
   aws configure set profile.snowballEdge.ca_bundle /path/to/ca-bundle.pem
   ```

After you complete the procedure, you can run CLI commands with these local credentials, your certificate, and your specified endpoint\.

## Unsupported Amazon EC2 Features for Snowball Edge<a name="unsupported-features-ec2-adapter"></a>

Using the Amazon EC2 endpoint, you can programmatically manage your AMIs and compute instances on a Snowball Edge with Amazon EC2 API operations\. However, not all features and API operations are supported for use with a Snowball Edge device\.

Any features or actions not explicitly listed as supported in this guide are not supported\. For example, the following Amazon EC2 actions are not supported for use with Snowball Edge:

  + \-\-tag\-specifications – The tags to apply to the resources during launch\. You can only tag instances on launch\. The specified tags are applied to all instances that are created during launch\. To tag a resource after it has been created, use `create-tags`\.
  + \-\-user\-data – The user data to make available to the instance\. If you are using the AWS CLI, base64\-encoding is performed for you, and you can load the text from a file\. Otherwise, you must provide base64\-encoded text\.
+ [start\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/start-instances.html) – Starts an `sbe` instance that you've previously stopped\. All resources attached to the instance persist through starts and stops, but are erased if the instance is terminated\.
  + \-\-instance\-ids – The IDs of one or more `sbe` instances that were stopped on the device\.
+ [stop\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/stop-instances.html) – Stops an `sbe` instance that is running\. All resources attached to the instance persist through starts and stops, but are erased if the instance is terminated\.
  + \-\-instance\-ids – The IDs of one or more `sbe` instances to be stopped on the device\.
+ [terminate\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/terminate-instances.html) – Shuts down one or more instances\. This operation is idempotent; if you terminate an instance more than once, each call succeeds\. All resources attached to the instance persist through starts and stops, but data is erased if the instance is terminated\.
**Note**  
By default, when you use a command like `shutdown` or `poweroff` to initiate a shutdown from your instance, the instance stops\. However, you can use the `InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior` attribute to change this behavior so that these commands terminiate your instance\. For more information, see [Changing the Instance Initiated Shutdown Behavior](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html#Using_ChangingInstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.
  + \-\-instance\-ids – The IDs of one or more `sbe` instances to be terminated on the device\. All associated data stored for those instances will be lost\.

## Supported Amazon EC2 API Operations<a name="using-ec2-adapter-supported-api"></a>

**Following, you can find Amazon EC2 API operations that you can use with a Snowball Edge, with links to their descriptions in the *Amazon EC2 API Reference\. *Amazon EC2 API calls require Signature Version 4 \(SigV4\) signing\. If you're using the AWS CLI or an AWS SDK to make these API calls, the SigV4 signing is handled for you\. Otherwise, you need to implement your own SigV4 signing solution\. For more information, see [Getting and Using Local Amazon S3 Credentials](using-adapter.md#adapter-credentials)\.**
