# Step 2: Choose Your Shipping Preferences<a name="shipping-detals"></a>

Receiving and returning a Snow Family device involves shipping the device back and forth, so it's important that you provide accurate shipping information\.

**To provide shipping details**

1. On the [AWS Snow Family Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/snowfamily/home), in the **Shipping Address** section, choose an existing address or add a new address\. 
   + If you choose **Use recent address**, the addresses on file are displayed\. Carefully choose the address that you want from the list\.
   + If you choose **Add a new address**, provide the requested address information\. The AWS Snow Family Management Console saves your new shipping information\.

     
**Note**  
The country that you provide in the address must match the destination country for the device and must be valid for that country\.

1. In the **Shipping speed** section, choose a shipping speed for the job\. This speed shows how quickly the device ships between destinations and doesn't reflect how soon it will arrive after today's date\. The shipping speeds you can choose are:
   + **One\-Day Shipping \(1 business day\)**
   + **Two\-Day Shipping \(2 business days\)**
   + **See [this list of all other shipping speeds](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/developer-guide/mailing-storage.html#shippingspeeds)**

1. Choose **Next**\.
