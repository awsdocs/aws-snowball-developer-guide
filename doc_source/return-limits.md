# Limitations on Processing Your Returned Snowball Edge for Import<a name="return-limits"></a>

To import your data into AWS, the device must meet the following requirements:
+ The AWS Snowball Edge device must not be compromised\. Except for opening the three doors on the front, back, and top, or to add and replace the optional air filter, don't open the AWS Snowball Edge device for any reason\.
+ The device must not be physically damaged\. You can prevent damage by closing the three doors on the Snowball Edge device until the latches make an audible clicking sound\.
+ The E Ink display on the Snowball Edge device must be visible\. It must also show the return label that was automatically generated when you finished transferring your data onto the AWS Snowball Edge device\.

**Note**  
All Snowball Edge devices returned that don't meet these requirements are erased without having any work performed on them\.
