# Limitations for AWS Snowball Edge Jobs<a name="job-limits"></a>

The following limitations exist for creating AWS Snowball Edge device jobs:
+ For security purposes, jobs using an AWS Snowball Edge device must be completed within 360 days of being prepared\. If you need to keep one or more devices for longer than 360 days, contact AWS Support\. Otherwise, after 360 days, the device becomes locked, can no longer be accessed, and must be returned\. If the AWS Snowball Edge device becomes locked during an import job, we can still transfer the existing data on the device into Amazon S3\.
+ Currently, the AWS Snowball Edge device doesn't support server\-side encryption with customer\-provided keys \(SSE\-C\)\. AWS Snowball Edge does support server\-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys \(SSE\-S3\) and server\-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service managed keys \(SSE\-KMS\)\. For more information, see [Protecting data using server\-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide*\.
+ If you're using an AWS Snowball Edge device to import data, and you need to transfer more data than will fit on a single Snowball Edge device, create additional jobs\. Each export job can use multiple Snowball Edge devices\.
+ The default service limit for the number of Snowball Edge devices you can have at one time is 1\. If you want to increase your service limit or create a cluster job, contact [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/)\.
+ Metadata for objects transferred to a device is not persisted, unless it's transferred with the file interface\. The only metadata that remains the same is `filename` and `filesize`\. All other metadata is set as in the following example: 

  `-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root [filesize] Dec 31 1969 [path/filename]`
