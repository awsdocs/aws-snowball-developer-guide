# AWS Snowball Device Differences<a name="device-differences"></a>

The Snowball and the Snowball Edge are two different devices\. This guide is for the Snowball Edge\. If you are looking for documentation for the Snowball, see the *[AWS Snowball User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/ug/whatissnowball.html)\.* Both devices allow you to move huge amounts of data into and out of Amazon S3, they both have the same [job management API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/api-reference/api-reference.html), and they both use the same [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/importexport)\. However, the two devices differ in hardware specifications, some features, what transfer tools are used, and price\.

## Snowball Edge Device Options<a name="device-options"></a>

Snowball Edge devices have three options for device configurations:
+ **Snowball Edge Storage Optimized** – This option of Snowball Edge device has the most storage capacity at up to 80 TB of useable storage space, 24 vCPUs, and 32 GiB of memory for compute functionality\.
+ **Snowball Edge Compute Optimized** – This option of Snowball Edge device has the most compute functionality with 52 vCPUs, 208 GiB of memory, and 7\.68 TB of dedicated NVMe SSD storage for instances\. This option also comes with 42 TB of additional storage space\.
+ **Snowball Edge Compute Optimized with GPU** – This option of Snowball Edge devices is identical to the compute optimized option, save for an installed GPU, equivalent to the one available in the P3 Amazon EC2 instance type\.

For more information on the compute functionality of these three options, see [Using Amazon EC2 Compute Instances](using-ec2.md)\.

**Note**  
When this guide refers to Snowball Edge devices, it's referring to all optional variants of the device\. Whenever specific information applies only to one or more optional configurations of devices, like how the Snowball Edge Compute Optimized with GPU option has an on\-board GPU peripheral, it will be mentioned explicitly\.

## AWS Snowball Use Case Differences<a name="usecase-differences"></a>

**Note**  
Workloads that need GPU support require the Snowball Edge Compute Optimized with GPU option\.

## AWS Snowball Hardware Differences<a name="hardware-differences"></a>

Following is a table that shows how the devices differ from each other, physically\. For information on specifications for the Snowball, see [AWS Snowball Specifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/ug/specifications.html)\. For information on specifications for the Snowball Edge, see [AWS Snowball Edge Specifications](specifications.md)\.


| Snowball | Snowball Edge | 
| --- | --- | 
|  ![\[The Snowball is a large briefcase-sized device that weighs less than 50 pounds and is used to transfer data.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/developer-guide/images/Snowball-closed-600w.png)  |  ![\[The Snowball Edge is a large briefcase-sized device that weighs less than 50 pounds and is used to transfer, store, or compute data.\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/developer-guide/images/Snowball-Edge-Image.png)  |
