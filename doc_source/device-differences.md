# AWS Snowball Device Differences<a name="device-differences"></a>

The Snowball and the Snowball Edge are two different devices\. This guide is for the Snowball Edge\. If you are looking for documentation for the Snowball, see the *[AWS Snowball User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/ug/whatissnowball.html)\.* Both devices allow you to move huge amounts of data into and out of Amazon S3, they both have the same [job management API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/api-reference/api-reference.html), and they both use the same [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/importexport)\. However, the two devices differ in hardware specifications, some features, what transfer tools are used, and price\.
