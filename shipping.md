**Note**  
When you create a job, you specify a shipping address and shipping speed\. This shipping speed doesn’t indicate how soon you can expect to receive the AWS Snowball Edge appliance from the day you created the job\. It only shows the time that the appliance is in transit between AWS and your shipping address\. That time doesn’t include any time for processing, which depends on factors including job type \(exports take longer than imports, typically\) and job size \(cluster jobs take longer than individual jobs, typically\)\. Also, carriers generally only pick up outgoing AWS Snowball Edge appliances once a day\. Thus, processing before shipping can take a day or more\.

**Note**  
If you've powered off and unplugged the AWS Snowball Edge appliance, and your shipping label doesn't appear after about a minute on the E Ink display on top of the appliance, contact [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/)\.

1. Disconnect and stow the power cable the AWS Snowball Edge appliance was sent with in the cable nook on top of the appliance\.

1. Close the three doors on the back, the top, and the front of the AWS Snowball Edge appliance, pressing in on each one at a time until you hear and feel them click\.

You don't need to pack the AWS Snowball Edge appliance in a container, because it is its own physically rugged shipping container\. The E Ink display on the top of the AWS Snowball Edge appliance changes to your return shipping label when the AWS Snowball Edge appliance is turned off\.
